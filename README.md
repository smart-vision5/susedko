[Fedora CoreOS] ignition config for my home server.

[Fedora CoreOS]: https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-coreos/getting-started/


## Development

To test locally or to install image to serverâ€™s SD card you need:

```sh
sudo dnf install make podman qemu-system-x86-core
```

Run in one terminal:

```sh
make demo
```

And then run in another terminal:

```sh
make shell
```

Press <kbd>Ctrl + A</kbd> <kbd>X</kbd> to exit demo server shell.

Call `make clean` to remove all temporary files from the dir and system.


## Install

Insert USB flash drive and call:

```sh
make flash
```

It will write image to `/dev/sda`. Change `Makefile` if you need another path.

Then insert drive to machine and boot it. It will automatically install
system to `/dev/mmcblk1` (change `Makefile` for another drive).

Create backup:

```sh
borg init --encryption repokey-blake2 ai@susedko.local:/var/mnt/vault/ai/.backup
~/Dev/environment/bin/backup
```
